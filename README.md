# Qwittig

Qwittig is an application that allows users to collect shopping receipts and split the costs within a group. The idea is that you take a picture of the receipt and everyone in the groups gets notified of the new purchase and how it affects the everyone's balance. 

This repository contains the small node.js backend that performed the OCR and calulcated the new balance of member in the group. The code of the Android client is available at [qwittig-android](https://github.com/fnberta/qwittig-android).

We shut down the project before this was ever used in production, meaning there are most certainly some rough edges here and there. The code is probably also dated by today's standards and could use some re-factoring.
